----------

This is a basic project, where I deconstruct and rebuild the Google search page using only HTML and CSS.

The intention here is not to be perfect, I wrote the language in a basic way, without being responsible, without some sort of organization in css or order in the components of the html. Just putting what I learned into practice.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

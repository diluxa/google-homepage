[Project](https://diluxa.github.io/google-homepage/)
----------

This is a basic project, where I made a copy of the Google search page using only HTML and CSS.

The intention here is not to be perfect, I wrote the language in a basic way, without being responsible, without some sort of organization in CSS or order in the components of the HTML. Just putting code into practice.
